# The Plimpton322 Theme
Plimpton322 is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages that is primarily targeted towards academic and scientific blogging. [You can preview the theme to see what it looks like](https://adrian-dalessandro.github.io/Plimpton322/ "Preview Plimpton322"), or even fork the project and use it today.

## Scientific Blogging
The philosophy behind this project is to support scientific bloggers & scientific communication. To do so, we provide a theme with out-of-the-box support for:
1. Latex-style equation support via MathJax ([see this post for an example](https://adrian-dalessandro.github.io/Plimpton322/2021/12/31/example-latex-math.html))
2. Markdown-style code blocks ([see this post for an example](https://adrian-dalessandro.github.io/Plimpton322/2021/12/30/example-python-blog-post.html))

beyond this, our goal is to provide an aesthetic & somewhat minimalist theme with built in customization options.

## Customizing
### Configuration variables
By default, the global configuration variables are stored in `_config.yml`. These are accessed through the `site._your_variable_` liquid variable throughout the project. The basic set of global configuration variables are:

```yaml
title: Plimpton 322 # This is the title of the site and controls the emphasized text in the site header
description: A jekyll theme for scientific blogging # This is a short site description that follows the title text
accent: green # This selects the sites colour-scheme, as explained below
paginate: 5 # This is the number of pages to dislay per page on the blog list page
paginate_path: "/blog/page:num/" # This controls the path to the different pages of the blog post
fb_comments_on: "true" # This toggles whether or not to use the facebook comments plugin
```
