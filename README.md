# The Plimpton322 Theme
Plimpton322 is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages that is primarily targeted towards academic and scientific blogging. [You can preview the theme to see what it looks like](https://adrian-dalessandro.github.io/Plimpton322/ "Preview Plimpton322"), or even fork the project and use it today.

## Scientific Blogging
The philosophy behind this project is to support scientific bloggers & scientific communication. To do so, we provide a theme with out-of-the-box support for:
1. Latex-style equation support via MathJax ([see this post for an example](https://adrian-dalessandro.github.io/Plimpton322/2021/12/31/example-latex-math.html))
2. Markdown-style code blocks ([see this post for an example](https://adrian-dalessandro.github.io/Plimpton322/2021/12/30/example-python-blog-post.html))

beyond this, our goal is to provide an aesthetic & somewhat minimalist theme with built in customization options.
